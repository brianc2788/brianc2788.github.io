        <h2>Yesterday's Hacktivists Versus Today's</h2>
        <p>
            I just finished watching Kevin Mitnick give a talk at Google ("Talks at Google,"
            find it on Youtube). I've heard the name before, but I didn't realize Mitnick was
            such an awesome hacker and all-around intelligent, good guy. He even has an
            interest in magic/illusions, which I do as well (particularly card. It's lame; I know.)!
            I also love hearing old-school phone-phreaker anecdotes; especially when the
            story teller is so legendary (Steve Wozniak also comes to mind).
        </p>
        <p>
            Again, I was familiar with his name and his being labeled a "hacktivist," but I now
            have a much greater respect for him. I am checking out a couple of his books
            (<em>The Art of Intrusion, The Art of Deception, </em>)
