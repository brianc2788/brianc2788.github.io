            <h2>Programming Experience</h2>
            <p>Just really quickly, I'd like to talk a little bit about my programming background.</p>
            <p>
                I have been an avid, strong computer user, basically, since I was born. I fondly
                remember cutting & pasting HTML code from tutorials and into my free website, hosted
                by <em>Angelfire</em> (Still around!) when I was in 5th grade. Of course, I was an
                accomplished PC gamer and built myself and my friends custom gaming PCs. We ordered
                the parts off of a website I found, called Newegg.com (the one-and-only) and we
                played games like Starcraft and Counter-Strike. I guess I have to mention, we were
                among the very first Steam users when we transitioned from CS 1.5 to version 1.6.
            </p>
            <p>
                I had begun to get serious about computer architecture & programming when I decided to
                enroll at my local community college as a computer science major (CS121). There, I started
                learning Cpp and Object-Oriented Programming paradigms, but more importantly, I
                started learning how a computer "thinks" and solves problems. I continued to
                write in C++, exclusively, for years. I made many console-based apps and eventually
                scratched the surface of development libraries like SDL2, SFML, and FLTK for GUI's
                and games.

                My second language, Python, was an excellent choice and I was very much enjoying the
                immediate feedback given by an interpreted language. It's so quick & easy to just run
                the interpreter (iPython, because I'm a huge CLI-user) and try something out. You can
                indulge even the most trivial of curiosities with very little effort. I went on to try
                several more languages like this; including Bash shell scripting and Javascript. I find
                these languages to be excellent in terms of convenience and productivity; obviously, this
                is the trade-off for speed & efficiency. Usually sufficing my needs, these languages have
                largely supplanted my need for C/C++. I've mostly relegated these languages to larger projects
                (possibly even with GUI front-ends using SDL2) and I dabble in kernel/drivers programming.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have to give a special mention to shell scripting. After I discovered GNU/Linux, I
                fell in love with the command-line. I even had access to a MS-DOS based PC in my early
                years, but I was far too young to use it; I had someone load clip-art or <em>Super Solvers:
                Midnight Rescue!</em>. I think shell scripting (bash) is an excellent reinforcement for
                programmers who want to learn Unix-like systems &AMP; the command-line interface. In my
                opinion, from there, it becomes much easier to learn the Windows analogues; the Windows
                command-prompt, Powershell, the .NET Framework, et al. Linux-based distibutions are the
                penultimate entry-point to understanding operating systems &AMP; kernel design. Ultimately,
                this would make anyone a better PC user and I would recommend learning shell scripting
                or Windows batch files to anyone looking to become a power user.

            <p>
                My current muse is golang; the Go programming language. Firstly, I'm a fan of Ken
                Thompson, who co-authored the language with two other geniuses. Go is a fantastic
                programming language. In my opinion, it succeeded, in spades, its project's goal,
                which was to create a modern, efficient, scalable high-level programming language
                with its own excellent toolchain. That's exactly how I feel about it; it's modern.
                For me, it's like C/C++ but easier to use due to its built-in mechanisms,
                packages & modules system, formatting w/tools, and more. Similar to other languages,
                it has the quality-of-life features that many programmers want, however, still contains
                the low-level facilities for those who need/want it.
            </p>
            <p>
                I feel so lucky that, not only have I found something in life that I crave and genuinely
                love, but I am blessed with the ability to learn it on my own by simply reading documentation,
                manuals, or other published, non-fiction literature. I find most video tutorials on Youtube
                or the like to be either only good for beginner fundamentals or not good for anything at all.
                I'm not kidding; reading comprehension and the ability to follow written instructions is an
                absolute necessity in the IT industry. Even seasoned veterens will tell you how they are
                constantly learning & reading to keep up with the ever-evolving world of technology. Beyond
                being an absolute expert in your programming language(s) of your choice, there is much more
                that separates the hobbyists from the professionals. What good is a single programmer when
                he or she can't collaborate with others? Just the word <em>collaboration</em> should invoke
                names like <em>Git</em> or <em>Slack</em> to mind. Even if one has no intention of working with
                others, these tools are indispensable whether you are a part of a team or not.
            </p>
            <p>
                I know I'm not the first to say this, however, I agree 100% that programming languages are tools and
                each tool has its own strengths and weaknesses. Tools are entirely useless without an effective
                user. Being capable of helping one's <em>self</em> and <em>others</em> are ingredients for
                success; I believe that the rest, including the knowledge and skill, will follow. I should also mention that
                even though I believe in my own words, I still waver from them, make mistakes, and revise it
                along the way as I grow. Please don't mistake my confidence or conviction with arrogance or hubris;
                I appreciate wisdom in others and, hopefully, myself when appropriate. At any rate, if this has
                resonated with you in any way, feel free to get in touch with me.
