        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            I am a life-long computer nerd with a natural drive & interest in all-things related. Programming
            is an amazing skill, which helps further my understanding of systems and networking design & principles.
            On the hardware side, it's always rewarding to be able to help a friend build a PC from scratch to save
            a few dollars - and in high school, this meant I had another person to play starcraft with online (56kbps!).
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently a college dropout and mostly auto-educated. Besides what I've already mentioned, I also have
            skills in binary analysis, packet analysis, relational database software, cryptography, and more.
            My advice for self-learners and beginners: don't neglect learning best-practices and how to collaborate
            with others (git, slack, etc). I believe this will help elevate us from hobbyists to professionals.

            <em>Read as many books from No Starch & O'Reilly publications as you can...</em>

            I also have a great respect for computer history; from the ENIAC, to rebellious phreakers & hackers from
            MIT or UC Berkeley, to the legendary people from Bell Labs at AT&T (now Nokia). Some of my personal heroes include Brian
            Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie of K&R fame, Richard Stallman (GNU, Free Software movement), Steve Wozniak (screw Steve Jobs),
            Bjarne Stoustrup (Cpp), Ken Thompson (Unix, co-author of Golang, etc, etc.), etc. I guess I can't exactly call
            these guys historic, since many of them are still extremely active today.
        </p>
        <p>I guess I'll leave it there; at least for now.</p>
