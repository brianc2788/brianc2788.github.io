            <h2>Programming Experience</h2>
            <p>Just really quickly, I'd like to talk a little bit about my programming background.</p>
            <p>
                I have been an avid, strong computer user, basically, since I was born. I fondly
                remember cutting & pasting HTML code from tutorials and into my free website, hosted
                by <em>Angelfire</em> (Still around!) when I was in 5th grade. Of course, I was an
                accomplished PC gamer and built myself and my friends custom gaming PCs. We ordered
                the parts off of a website I found, called Newegg.com (the one-and-only) and we
                played games like Starcraft and Counter-Strike. I guess I have to mention, we were
                among the very first Steam users when we transitioned from CS 1.5 to version 1.6.
            </p>
            <p>
                I had begun to get serious about computers & programming when I decided to enroll at
                my local community college as a computer science major (CS121). There, I started
                learning Cpp and Object-Oriented Programming paradigms, but more importantly, I
                started learning how a computer "thinks" and solves problems. I continued to
                write in C++, exclusively, for years. I made many console-based apps and eventually
                scratched the surface of development libraries like SDL2, SFML, and FLTK for GUI's
                and games.

            <p>
                Finally, I started branching out into other languages. I realized that, a good
                programmer isn't limited by any single, high-level programming languages; one should
                be able to become proficient in absolutely any language after learning the necessary
                fundamentals. After learning your third language or so, you start to feel this confidence.
            </p>

                My second language, Python, was an excellent choice and I was very much enjoying the
                immediate feedback given by an interpreted language. It's so quick & easy to just run
                the interpreter (iPython, because I'm a huge CLI-user) and try something out. You can
                indulge even the most trivial of curiosities with very little effort.
            </p>
            <p>
                My current muse is golang; the Go programming language. Firstly, I'm a fan of Ken
                Thompson, who co-authored the language with two other geniuses. Go is a fantastic
                programming language. In my opinion, it succeeded, in spades, its project's goal,
                which was to create a modern, efficient, scalable high-level programming language
                with its own excellent toolchain. That's exactly how I feel about it; it's modern.
                For me, it's like C/C++ but easier to use due to its built-in mechanisms & facilities,
                packages & modules system, formatting w/tools, 
            </p>
            <p>
                I feel so lucky that, not only have I found something in life that I crave and genuinely
                love, but I am blessed with the ability to learn it on my by simply reading documentation,
                manuals, or other published, non-fiction literature. I find most video tutorials on Youtube
                or the like to be either only good for beginner fundamentals or not good for anything at all.
                Every single day I get a little smarter, in some capacity, in regards to computers. It's
                not always programming; it could be 
            </p>
