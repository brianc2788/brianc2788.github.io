            <h2>Programming Experience</h2>
            <p>Just really quickly, I'd like to talk a little bit about my programming background.</p>
            <p>
                I have been an avid, strong computer user, basically, since I was born. I fondly
                remember cutting & pasting HTML code from tutorials and into my free website, hosted
                by <em>Angelfire</em> (Still around!) when I was in 5th grade. Of course, I was an
                accomplished PC gamer and built myself and my friends custom gaming PCs. We ordered
                the parts off of a website I found, called Newegg.com (the one-and-only) and we
                played games like Starcraft and Counter-Strike. I guess I have to mention, we were
                among the very first Steam users when we transitioned from CS 1.5 to version 1.6.
                I also got my first exposure to IRC, which was the first time I thoroughly feared
                for my computer's security (lol!). Though I loved the tangible, hardware side of computing,
                it turned out to be too expensive of a hobby. The software side, however, has fairly
                inexpensive prerequisites in comparison. It also is a much greater creative outlet which,
                given enough time and effort, can become a very powerful, very practical skill.
            </p>

                I had begun to get serious about computer architecture & programming when I decided to
                enroll at my local community college as a computer science major (CS121). There, I started
                learning Cpp and Object-Oriented Programming paradigms, but more importantly, I
                started learning how a computer "thinks" and solves problems. I continued to
                write in C++, exclusively, for years. I made many console-based apps and eventually
                scratched the surface of development libraries like SDL2, SFML, and FLTK for GUI's
                and games.

                My second language, Python, was an excellent choice and I was very much enjoying the
                immediate feedback given by an interpreted language. It's so quick & easy to just run
                the interpreter (iPython, because I'm a huge CLI-user) and try something out. You can
                indulge even the most trivial of curiosities with very little effort. I went on to try
                several more languages like this; including Bash shell scripting and Javascript. I find
                these languages to be excellent in terms of convenience and productivity; obviously, this
                is the trade-off for speed & efficiency. Usually sufficing my needs, these languages have
                largely supplanted my need for C/C++. I've mostly relegated these languages to larger projects
                (possibly even with GUI front-ends using SDL2) and I dabble in kernel/drivers programming.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have to give a special mention to shell scripting. After I discovered GNU/Linux, I
                fell in love with the command-line. I even had access to a MS-DOS based PC in my early
                years, but I was far too young to use it; I had someone load clip-art or <em>Super Solvers:
                Midnight Rescue!</em>. I think shell scripting (bash) is an excellent reinforcement for
                programmers who want to learn Unix-like systems &AMP; the command-line interface. In my
                opinion, from there, it becomes much easier to learn the Windows analogues; the Windows
                command-prompt, Powershell, the .NET Framework, et al. Linux-based distibutions are the
                penultimate entry-point to understanding operating systems &AMP; kernel design. Ultimately,
                this would make anyone a better PC user and I would recommend learning shell scripting
                or Windows batch files to anyone looking to become a power user.

                My current muse is golang; the Go programming language. Firstly, I'm a fan of Ken
                Thompson, who co-authored the language with two other geniuses. Go is a fantastic
                programming language. In my opinion, it succeeded, in spades, its project's goal,
                which was to create a modern, efficient, scalable high-level programming language
                with its own excellent toolchain. That's exactly how I feel about it; it's modern.
                For me, it's like C/C++ but easier to use due to its built-in mechanisms,
                packages & modules system, formatting w/tools, and more. Similar to other languages,
                it has the quality-of-life features that many programmers want, however, still contains
                the low-level facilities for those who need/want it.<br>
                *P.S. - I've been working with Go now for awhile; see godev repo. Now that I've been
                writing Go code for awhile, my opinions of it have evolved a bit. I find it to be a
                pretty involved, somewhat encumbersome programming language, although, once one becomes
                accustomed to its slightly more verbose syntax &AMP; error handling, it almost
                <em>forces</em> the programmer to use best practices and thus will create better
                applications. It clearly has many strengths. One of its most prominent features is its
                concurrent <em>goroutines</em>, but again, it feels like Go is forcing its ideology
                on you, when sometimes you just wanna run some code and see if it works. The same goes
                for its <em>interfaces</em> and <em>channel</em> facilities; excellent, robust
                features, but not always necessary or wanted. I suppose that is the usual compromise
                that takes place when one chooses a compiled language that prioritizes speed &AMP;
                efficiency; nearly above all-else.
            </p>

                I feel so lucky that, not only have I found something in life that I crave and genuinely
                love, but I am blessed with the ability to learn it on my own by simply reading documentation,
                manuals, or other published, non-fiction literature. I find most video tutorials on Youtube
                or the like to be either only good for beginner fundamentals or not good for anything at all.
                I'm not kidding; reading comprehension and the ability to follow written instructions is an
                absolute necessity in the IT industry. Even seasoned veterens will tell you how they are
                constantly learning & reading to keep up with the ever-evolving world of technology. Beyond
                being an absolute expert in your programming language(s) of your choice, there is much more
                that separates the hobbyists from the professionals. What good is a single programmer when
                he or she can't collaborate with others? Just the word <em>collaboration</em> should invoke
                names like <em>Git</em> or <em>Slack</em> to mind. Even if one has no intention of working with
                others, these tools are indispensable whether you are a part of a team or not.
            </p>
            <p>
                I know I'm not the first to say this, however, I agree 100% that programming languages are tools and
                each tool has its own strengths and weaknesses. Tools are entirely useless without an effective
                user. Being capable of helping one's <em>self</em> and <em>others</em> are ingredients for
                success; I believe that the rest, including the knowledge and skill, will follow. I should also mention that
                even though I believe in my own words, I still waver from them, make mistakes, and revise it
                along the way as I grow. Please don't mistake my confidence or conviction with arrogance or hubris;
                I appreciate wisdom in others and, hopefully, myself when appropriate. I believe that this
                genuine craving to understand computers from a low-level, physical, literal, applied-science level
                all the way up to, inclusively, the highest levels of abstraction and theory.
                At any rate, if this has resonated with you in any way, feel free to get in touch with me.
