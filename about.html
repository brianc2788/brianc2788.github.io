        <h2>Programming Experience</h2>
        <p>Just really quickly, I'd like to talk a little bit about my programming background.</p>
        <p>
            I have been an avid, strong computer user, basically, since I was born. I fondly
            remember cutting & pasting HTML code from tutorials and into my free website, hosted
            by <em>Angelfire</em> (Still around!) when I was in 5th grade. Of course, I was an
            accomplished PC gamer and built myself and my friends custom gaming PCs. We ordered
            the parts off of a website I found, called Newegg.com (the one-and-only) and we
            played games like Starcraft and Counter-Strike. I guess I have to mention, we were
            among the very first Steam users when we transitioned from CS 1.5 to version 1.6.
        </p>
        <p>
            I had begun to get serious about computers & programming when I decided to enroll at
            my local community college as a computer science major (CS121). There, I started
            learning Cpp and Object-Oriented Programming paradigms, but more importantly, I
            started learning how a computer "thinks" and solves problems. I continued to
            write in C++, exclusively, for years. I made many console-based apps and eventually
            scratched the surface of development libraries like SDL2, SFML, and FLTK for GUI's
            and games.
        </p>

            Finally, I started branching out into other languages. I realized that, a good
            programmer isn't limited by any single, high-level programming languages; one should
            be able to become proficient in absolutely any language after learning the necessary
            fundamentals. After learning your third language or so, you start to feel this confidence.
        </p>

            My second language, Python, was an excellent choice and I was very much enjoying the
            immediate feedback given by an interpreted language.
