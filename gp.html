        If you are blessed with a family that supports you,<br>
        loves you, makes you feel safe & secure, any or all of<br>
        the above.&hellip;<br>
        God bless your love.<br>
        <br>
        <u>Now Dedicated to Greg 'Big Money' Pitillo</u><br>
        As if my life weren't hard enough and the odds weren't stacked against<br>
        me any higher, <strong>GREG PITILLO</strong> ruined what little life I<br>
        had left from the salvage. I have survived a couple dozen years of both<br>
        physical abuse at the hands of others and substance abuse at the hands of<br>
        myself, but I didn't stand a chance against "Big Money" and his torment;<br>
        especially his abuse of my cat who is my one and only friend & family.<br>
        He drove a wedge through my relationship with her and my mother and my<br>
        life is forever scarred - big time.<br>
        <br>
        Just add me to the list I guess; he ruined the lives of another single<br>
        mother and 'rescued' a dog that grew up in a cardboard box, only to leave<br>
        him alone in his apartment for 2 weeks - ALONE. Guy is a straight-up animal<br>
        abuser and is currently suing his now-ex wife, who also learned the hard way,<br>
        this man is as selfish as it gets. That's just this summer, by the way.<br>
        He's ruined countless relationships due to money. He lures you in; offers to<br>
        loan you some money when you're down or seem like a nice, caring provider, but<br>
        -- BAM! -- once he's got you, he thinks he owns you. He takes interest and he<br>
        doesn't want money -- he has plenty -- he wants your submission. His victims<br>
        include his own sister, friends, and this poor woman he's divorcing (not just<br>
        divorcing her, but trying to F her up, financially, out of pure spite.)<br>
        <br>
        My mom wants nothing more to do with me apparently, so now this commit is dedicated<br>
        to GREG "BIG MONEY" PITILLO -- may your higher power protect you from this creep.<br>
