                    I get a ton of use out of this. When I first started learning about web scraping using
                    BeautifulSoup4 (Python3), I immediately thought of scraping Google for the definitions
                    of words. I had grown really accustomed to going to google and typing 'define' plus a
                    word I wanted to look up. Long story short, I ended up scraping Merriam-Webster's
                    website (This was also still a bit before I started getting into web API's). For me,
                    this is how I started <em>eating my own dogfood</em>, for those who are familiar with
                    the phrase. Clocking in at about 60 lines of python (around 0.06 KLOCS - Lol. I forgot
                    who came up with that; AT&T? MS?), it's nothing special and there's plenty of room for
                    improvement. Speaking of improvements, a graphical interface would be the most obvious
                    thing to implement -- could be just the excuse I need to crack open a No Starch book I
                    have for Python GUIs; that, or just use pygame. Anyways, because of how much it improves
                    productivity for me, I think it would be more than worth it to implement best practices,
                    docstrings, more robust exception handling and options, ...
