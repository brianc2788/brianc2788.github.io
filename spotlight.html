                A digital clock GUI leveraging the time module &AMP; pygame. What's great about
                pygame is that it uses SDL2; a development library native to the C language. SDL2
                is open-source software that allows developers to create windows and graphical
                applications for all major operating systems (desktop &AMP; mobile). Without much
                effort, I was able to use pygame to create this Python application that I was able
                to test on Linux &AMP; Windows 10. Pygame provides an excellent entry point for
                beginners looking to get into GUI or game creation. I'd also like to mention the
                very-cool, open <em>Pixeltype</em> font.

                I get so much use out of this script, it isn't even funny! For so long, I had
                gotten used to just typing "define (word here)" in google to look up definitions
                for words. As a matter of fact, originally, I was planning to scrape those exact
                definitions from google's website, but ended up going with Merriam-Webster's
                online offering. The script itself isn't all that impressive and I am always
                coming back to it. However, it wasn't really written with much extensibility
                in mind. Rather than improving it, I find myself wanting to do it even better
                justice by rewriting it from scratch either with Python or another language.

                Using some well-known math formulas, this console app generates an accurate
                representation of any given month and print it to the screen. I wrote this quite
                a few years ago when I still favored prompting the user for input over command
                line arguments. It wasn't until a bit later that I discovered the linux shell and
                never looked back. The user enters the month and year of their choice and the app
                prints an accurate, visual representation of that month. It also indicates if that
                year is a leap year. Kind of boring, honestly -- Lol.
