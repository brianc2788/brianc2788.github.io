                    I get a ton of use out of this. When I first started learning about web scraping using
                    BeautifulSoup4 (Python3), I immediately thought of scraping Google for the definitions
                    of words. I had grown really accustomed to going to google and typing 'define' plus a
                    word I wanted to look up. Long story short, I ended up scraping Merriam-Webster's
                    website (This was also still a bit before I started getting into web API's). For me,
                    this is how I started <em>eating my own dogfood</em>, for those who are familiar with
                    the phrase. Clocking in at about 60 lines of python (around 0.06 KLOCS - Lol. I forgot
                    who came up with that; AT&T? MS?), it's nothing special and there's plenty of room for
                    improvement. Speaking of improvements, a graphical interface would be the most obvious
                    thing to implement -- could be just the excuse I need to crack open a No Starch book I
                    have for Python GUIs; that, or just use pygame. Anyways, because of how much it improves
                    productivity for me, I think it would be more than worth it to implement best practices,
                    docstrings, more robust exception handling and options, ...

                    A digital clock GUI leveraging the time module &AMP; pygame. Pygame's not just for
                    games. I'm glad I mentioned that I used pygame; not like the module prints any
                    gratuitous self-inserts or anything... Yeah, hello to you too, pygame community.
                    It's actually a minor grievance; pygame is a nice module, but I also have to
                    acknowledge that it's more of a wrapper for SDL2, which is implemented natively in
                    the C language. The thing that hurts me a bit here, is that I've actually produced
                    a couple interactive demos using it. That being said, this is why I don't really
                    want to hate on pygame so much -- it's really just meant for demos or Proof-Of-Concept
                    projects. The Python language itself is a poor choice for serious game development.
                    I love Python, but I love it for its productivity, speed, and portability. It's not
                    totally infeasible to use Python and/or pygame for a game or similarly large, intensive
                    applications and it does happen, but I personally disagree with this practice. It would
                    very much behoove any developer to use pygame as a PoC platform and move on to C for
                    its native SDL2 support as well as its intrinsic benefits.

            <h2>calendar-cli</h2>
            <img src="img/ss_clical_01.png" alt="Screenshot of cli-cal; written in C&#43;&#43;." style="max-with:50%; height:auto; margin-bottom:12%" />

            <p>
                This C&#43;&#43; program was originally created to satisfy the final project
                that was assigned to my CS121 class, at the end of my first two semesters at my
                local community college. The class was given two formulas; the first would calculate
                whether or not a given date was a leap-year. The second formula calculated the day
                of the week of the first day occurred on; also for a given month and year. We were
                being graded on our ability to visually represent these calendars in the console,
                which relied on things like loops and formatting.
            </p>
            <p>
                Heheh - Embarrassingly enough, there are still a couple bugs in it that can ruin
                the experience. It actually does exactly as advertised for most dates you can give
                to it. However, as an example, the entire year of 2022 mis-aligns the first week
                of any given month; printing it too far to the right of the screen and alienating
                itself.
