                    I get so much use out of this script, it isn't even funny! For so long, I had
                    gotten used to just typing "define (word here)" in google to look up definitions
                    for words. As a matter of fact, originally, I was planning to scrape those exact
                    definitions from google's website, but ended up going with Merriam-Webster's
                    online offering. The script itself isn't all that impressive and I am always
                    coming back to it. However, it wasn't really written with much extensibility
                    in mind. Rather than improving it, I find myself wanting to do it even better
                    justice by rewriting it from scratch either with Python or another language.

                    A digital clock GUI leveraging the time module &AMP; pygame.
                    I'm glad I mentioned that I used pygame; not like the module prints any
                    gratuitous self-inserts or anything... Yeah, hello to you too, pygame community.
                    It's actually a minor grievance; pygame is an excellent tool and fulfills its
                    goals of delivering a simple &AMP; easy-to-use graphical module optimized for
                    Python. Pygame uses SDL2, which supports C natively, so I'm sure the pygame devs
                    squeezed as much efficiency and optimizations out as they could. There's a lot of
                    trade-offs, as there generally are when choosing between interpreted languages and
                    compiled ones. As someone who learned C/C&#43;&#43; and wrote a couple 2-D game
                    demos with SDL2 and its image &AMP; true-type font extensions, I almost find it
                    sacrilegious to embed them beneath another programming language (LOL). I've
                    personally always thought of Python as a productivity-oriented language, and for
                    that, modules like pygame will always have their place in the programming universe.

            <h2>calendar-cli</h2>
            <img src="img/ss_clical_01.png" alt="Screenshot of cli-cal; written in C&#43;&#43;." style="max-with:50%; height:auto; margin-bottom:12%" />

            <p>
                This C&#43;&#43; program was originally created to satisfy the final project
                that was assigned to my CS121 class, at the end of my first two semesters at my
                local community college. The class was given two formulas; the first would calculate
                whether or not a given date was a leap-year. The second formula calculated the day
                of the week of the first day occurred on; also for a given month and year. We were
                being graded on our ability to visually represent these calendars in the console,
                which relied on things like loops and formatting.
            </p>
            <p>
                Heheh - Embarrassingly enough, there are still a couple bugs in it that can ruin
                the experience. It actually does exactly as advertised for most dates you can give
                to it. However, as an example, the entire year of 2022 mis-aligns the first week
                of any given month; printing it too far to the right of the screen and alienating
                itself. Every time I think about debugging these issues, I start wanting to rewrite
                the code completely using object-oriented paradigms. Then I think it would be a good
                idea to also write it in Python or Go. Then I get overwhelmed and move on to something
                else.
