        <h2>To Be Continued...</h2>
        <p>
            So, my site sucks and is in need of a pretty massive overhaul.
        </p>
        <p>
            Expect a short hiatus while a finish a book or two; one of which being
            <em>The Tangled Web</em> by Michael Zalewski (big recommend!). I consider
            myself thoroughly introduced to the core web languages; HTML, CSS, Javascript,
            and many modern server-side scripting languages, but I have a lot of work to do
            in the way of refinement.
        </p>
        <p>
            Basically, I just don't like where things are currently headed. I'd like to get
            the design down before adding anything more to this mess. It's also horrific in
            its current state and I'll have to redo everything, but with a few lessons learned.
        </p>
        <p>
            I think I convinced myself that I was just doing this to learn more about the core
            web programming stack, but it would have been nice to come up with something
            interesting or useful -- Heheh.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thanks for playing along.

        <h2>EU Financing Game Dev Tools?</h2>
        <p>
            Believe it or not, this is absolutely <strong>NOT</strong> the first time I have
            seen an eastern European game developer recieve a global handout.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Spacewalkers</em> has just released their second-ever title; <em>Ukranian Defense Force</em>.
            Haven't tried it, but I'm sure you get to do little more than seek to destroy the invading
            Russian forces. You think these guys are capable? Based on what?
        </p>
        <p>
            I think the EU should be pretty damned ashamed. There's plenty of better causes out there.
        </p>
        <p>
            <u>Link:</u> <a href="http://spacewalkers.games">Spacewalkers.games</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            P.S. - I hate to mention this because I actually enjoy this game, but the guys behind <em>GTFO</em>
            are also guilty of the same thing. I just can't believe that's where the EU's money is going.
            If Ukraine and these other countries can't support themselves, defend themselves, their leader's
            qualifications are "Comedian" then maybe they shouldn't be countries.

        <h2>I2P - Anonymizing Network Layer</h2>
        <p>
            There are a lot of I2P evangelists out there which makes me wonder how good the protocol
            is. TOR has been around for quite a long time now, and this may just be some level of
            paranoia talking, but I feel that TOR isn't as good as it used to be.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have to admit that I'm not greatly interested in the dark web, but I feel that I am
            often coming across a headline or whitepaper that claims to have found a weakness in
            TOR, its relays, services, what-have-you, or have found a way to de-anonymize its users.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are more protocols out there beyond both TOR & I2P and they would have presumably
            learned from any mistakes garnered by the TOR project. What's more, it seems that many
            developers are showing much more urgency and forward-thinking when considering the advent
            of quantum computing. Either way, if privacy and/or anonymity is the goal, its usually
            best to be changing ones habits -- Translation: If you've been using TOR and your favorite
            cryptocurrency for awhile, it's probably time to expand your portfolio.
        </p>
        <p>
            P.S. I would also like to add that I am mostly disappointed with the dark web community.
            They are rarely the infosec experts they think they are.
        </p>
        <p>
            For every DeSnake or ex-phreaker on the dark web, there's a thousand more wanna-be's.
            Not saying I'm better than anyone or anything, but I know my limits and most of these
            self-described <em>hackers</em> (ugh, hate that term these days) are totally rote and
            ineffective.

        <h2>Sep 25, 2022</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 11px">
            <em>An article from EFF.org:</em>
            <a href="http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/09/how-ditch-facebook-without-losing-your-friends-or-family-customers-or-communities">How to Ditch Facebook Without Losing Your Friends or Family, Customers or Communities</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            Came across this article earlier today while checking out the <em>EFF</em>'s homepage.
            Since I recently just deactivated (soon-to-be deleted) my Facebook account, I thought
            I might add a few details that I think were left out in the article.
        </p>
        <p>
            The only way to delete your Facebook account is to head over to your settings to find
            an option to <em>deactivate</em> your account, which will flag it for deletion after
            thirty days. I'm sure the hope is that you will change your mind and reactivate your
            account. Pretty insidious technique; it works. I have attempted to delete my account
            several times, but alas, I am weak. I convince myself that it's worth keeping just to
            stay in touch with the occasional friend or family member, but it's not. Stay strong
            for 30 days and be free from

        <h2>.NET Tutorials</h2>
        <p>
            Just wanted to post something more tech-related to get things back<br>
            on-track a bit.<br>
            At this point, Linux-based distros are my daily-driver OS; I use my<br>
            Windows 10 Desktop mostly for gaming. I think the main reason for that is<br>
            because it's easy to find guides & tutorials for <em>"aspiring hackers"</em> that<br>
            use old, even deprecated, tricks of the trade, however, it's nearly impossible to<br>
            find decent resources for Windows PC equivalents, which are based on Microsoft's .NET<br>
            framework (pronounced <em>dotnet</em>).
        </p>
        <p>
            If I'm right, perhaps there's a void there that could allow me to contribute<br>
            something new, rather than providing yet another, probably un-needed tutorial<br>
            that explains how to interrogate your system for network information via the shell.

        <h2>Not enough X Files</h2>
        <p>
            If there's anyone else out there also binging out on all-thing <em>X Files</em>,<br>
            the movies look very promising (<em>Fight the Future</em>, <em>I Still Want to Believe</em>).<br>
            There's also a few video games, but the only one worth giving any notice to is <em>The X Files:<br>
            Resist or Serve</em>. It's an older Playstation 2 exclusive and there seem to be some favorable<br>
            reviews out there -- I hope to check it out some time soon for myself. Typically, it's not a good<br>
            idea to get excited about games based on television IPs, but I can be pretty superficial and I<br>
            usually get decent value out of even bad games if I am a fan of the source material or characters.<br>
            The wiki for the game suggests its highly inspired by the classic Resident Evil survival horror<br>
            titles, which got a lot of flak for the tank controls & fixed camera angles, however, I am<br>
            apparently in the minority as I find those aspects to be both artistically appropriate and<br>
            quite enjoyable, barring a very minor learning-curve.

                to dedicate a page on my site to her. I want to put up pictures and write<br>
                a bit about her. I want to immortalize her by giving her a place on our<br>

            Update: Sep 13, 2022</h2>
            <p>
                Added a NavBar as a sort of place-holder for future content.<br>
                Truthfully, I don't think I really enjoy front-end development,<br>
                like designing a static web page or dynamic web application. I really<br>
                like InfoSec, although it is a very intimidating, very multi-disciplinary<br>
                type of field with a LOT of competition these days; I was actually hoping<br>
                that making a website would help me see things from the "other side," I.e.,<br>
                I wanted to see if I could make a website and learn some best practices for<br>
                <em>creating</em> something on the web, rather than trying to <em>break</em> it.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                That's why if you get into the industry of IT or InfoSec, you will probably<br>
                end up hearing that developers make good hackers at some point; again, those<br>
                who are good at creating the front and back ends of web sites often know the<br>
                best course of action for pentesting or other security assessments.
            </p>
            <p>
                Even so, I was thinking that, since I already have gotten familiar with Markdown<br>
                and writing <em>Jupyter notebooks</em>, I could just throw those up on here and<br>
                continue adding tutorials, ctf write-ups, etc. As I continue to learn and get better<br>
                with web tech, I would like to write easy-to-understand tutorials for beginners as well<br>
                as contribute more in-depth discussion towards more advanced topics; such as <em>log4j</em>.
            </p>

            <h2>I love the X Files!</h2>
            <p>
                Anybody else out there watching TV over the air? My family has a couple<br>
                antennas, so I will watch it from time to time. I think it's amazing how<br>
                I still prefer not having control of my entertainment sometimes, rather than<br>
                being able to choose when, where, and how you watch or stream anything these<br>
                days.
            </p>
            <p>
                This summer I started watching this channel <em>Comet</em>, which has this very awe-<br>
                some, very nostalgic programming consisting of <em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</em> and<br>
                <em>The X Files</em>.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>Holy crap, I'm in love with the X Files.</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                As I child, I actually grew to strongly dislike shows like <em>The X Files</em>,<br>
                <em>Star Trek</em>, <em>Nick @ Night</em>, etc. because, they pretty much marked<br>
                the end of the TV that I liked, which was of course cartoons.
            </p>
            <p>
                Haha, but I digress, what an amazing show. Agents Mulder & Scully balance each other<br>
                so well -- Mulder, who has a poster in his office that perfectly sums him up, that reads<br>
                <em>"I Want to Believe,"</em> and Scully, who is as pragmatic as she is intelligent.<br>
                Together, they exemplify both the fringe and the level-headed, scientific approaches.
            </p>
            <p>
                I started streaming the series, starting at season 1. I may create an area on the site<br>
                for entertainment-related content. If I do, I'd like to comment more on the show and its<br>
                themes, cast, story, et al. Seems to be a lot there as well. There's a couple movies, some<br>
                video games, and the show itself is 11 seasons. It also seems to take a turn for a more<br>
                comedic tone while also making various statements on political & current events.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Either way, I'm hoping to start to develop the site further; both in terms of code and content.
