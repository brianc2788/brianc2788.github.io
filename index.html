            <h1>Game Dev Roadmap</h1>
            <p>
                Lately, I've gotten more serious and a lot more excited about the prospect of developing a
                fully-featured game. Currently, I want to finish the vertical shoot-em-up (shmup) I've been
                sharing in my posts. There's also a few other ideas I'd like to do something with; including
                casino-card games and a multiplayer game inspired by <em>Pong</em>. I personally <em>love</em>
                the 8-bit and 16-bit generations of video games, but I feel some games are better represented in
                a 3D space, so I'll eventually get into OpenGL as well. There's a method to the madness and it's
                all moving toward the eventual goal of building a full game from scratch. I think after I build
                a few smaller games, solve some game-related challenges, I'll be in a much better position to
                estimate the feasibility of creating an entire game from scratch and what kind of art/visual
                style I can accomplish. I know there's solutions to game-creation, like <em>Unreal</em> and
                <em>Unity</em>, but personally, I'd really like to create the engine and be able to modify it
                if necessary. As great as these platforms are, I'm sure many people are aware of practices,
                like <em>asset flipping</em>, that allow people to prey on consumers, which is extremely damaging
                to the truly-independent, solo developer. I can usually tell when a game is sort of "glued together,"
                and I think most people can as well.
            </p>
            <p>
                That's about it for game development. I'm leaving myself a lot of flexibility so I can create other
                projects or improve old ones. The <em>pydev</em> repository needs reorganizing and some of the
                projects should be set up for <em>setuptools</em> and be using virtual environments.

            <h1>Building SFML on Linux</h1>
            <div class="img-box">
            <img src="img/ss_sfml1_01.webp" alt="Screenshot of project sfml1." width="50%">
            </div>
            <p>
                Hey, all.<br>
                Just wanted to share a couple thoughts after trying out <em>SFML</em>, a library for developing
                cross-platform, graphical applications. I was highly interested in using this library for games
                and GUIs and wanted to see how it compares to another popular library, SDL2. I followed a tutorial
                on the official <em>SFML</em> site, which demonstrated how to quickly create a window, texture, some
                text, and render it to the screen. My first impression is that this is much easier to use than SDL2.
                I can't say a whole lot, since I haven't done much with it yet, but I'm worried that the ease-of-use
                may have trade-offs with granularity and control over certain aspects of the windowing/rendering
                subsystems. At this point, I'm planning to continue to use SDL2 to develop a couple games/demos
                (including the vert. shooter from past posts), but I'm seriously considering a game or GUI with
                SFML afterwards.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'd like to take this as an oppertunity to say how pleased I am with Linux as a development
                environment. Many Linux distributions will have development libraries available in their package
                repositories, but even if yours doesn't, it's still easier to install third-party libraries than
                it is on Windows for Visual Studio (in my humble opinion). Visual Studio and Visual C are notorious,
                especially for new programmers, for being difficult to set options for compilation &AMP; linking.
                For me, using SFML was as simple as installing the libraries via a package manager, adding the include
                directives to the source code, and passing arguments to the compiler/linker (I use the Gnu Compiler
                Collection &AMP; Make).

            <p>
                So far, I'm pretty happy with the process I have in place for creating these game assets. I've tried
                a few art programs and sprite editors, looking for something to help produce artificial 8-bit/16-bit
                pixelated aesthetics. What you're seeing in the screenshot above is from the <em>Gnu Image Manipulation
                Program</em>, AKA <em>GIMP</em>. I've been utilizing its grid feature to help create these graphics
                inspired by the original <em>Gameboy</em> and its black and green, non-back-lit screen.
                I'm not sure how much will come out of this project. The main goal will be to just see it through to
                a functioning game.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is probably going to be the year I start producing some better, graphical programs. I'm trying
                not to think too far ahead, but I'm also hoping to try out some other graphical libraries, like
                <em>SFML</em> and <em>wxWidgets</em>. These wouldn't be for games, but for graphical, window-based
                GUI applications. I also have <em>Android Studio</em> installed (along with its <em>AVD</em> utility for
                creating virtual devices) and am absolutely dying to make something for droid. This is another oppertunity
                to make games, even multiplayer ones, and I'd really like to create a network/port scanner since Android
                lacks a lot of those tools built-in and I didn't find anything decent in the app store.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lots to think about; this year should be quite graphical. Speaking of Android, I committed some new code
                to my Python3 repository regarding an HTTP server/file-sharing tool.

                Every once in awhile I get an itch to make a video game. These screenshots
                show a couple game demos intended to become a small, vertically-scrolling,
                arcade-style shooter game. Though it's not the first of its kind from me, it's
                my most recent attempt. I started just to try out Python's <em>pygame</em> mod
                which uses bindings for the SDL2 development libraries. The part of game
                development I find most difficult is creating/acquiring assets. Feeling slightly
                more ambitious, I moved on to re-use these assets and rewrite my little game
                engine in C++.<br>
                Currently, I'm still playing with the code at times. I just want to refamiliarize
                myself with SDL2 and a couple of its supporting libraries (image, ttf). I probably
                won't continue on this particular demo for much longer, but after a couple more
                exercises with graphics and GUIs, I might come back to it.<br>
                If the 8-bit esque aesthetics are off-putting to you, feel free to create something
                better and donate it to me! (<em>Lol&lt;3</em>). I was somewhat inspired by the
                original <em>Gameboy</em>'s presentation; so much so that I also considered a
                black-and-puke-green color palette! For those who are interested in game development
                and also struggling with art, there are alternatives, such as buying assets on the
                <em>Unity</em> game engine's online market. Furthermore, for aspiring game developers,
                there's never been a more accessible time. Using <em>Unity</em> as en example again,
                they have their own, entirely unique scripting engine that someone could theoretically
                learn and create a full-on, triple-A video game title from scratch with (don't try this
                at home lol).

                Just wanted to share a few of the books that currently have my attention. I absolutely
                love <em>O'Reilly</em> &AMP; <em>No Starch</em> books. Between these two publications,
                you can learn any technology you want and will get expert tutoring. I greatly prefer
                this over scouring Youtube or the internet for quality content.
            </p>
            <p><b>Network Programming with Go</b> provides an excellent introduction to TCP and UDP
                transport protocols and, of course, uses golang as its medium.<br>
                <b>Black Hat Go</b> is another great book, but should be read <em>after</em> one
                posesses a good foundation of networking and the Go programming language itself.<br>
                <b>Programming Bitcoin</b> is helping me take a deep-dive into elliptic curve
                cryptography and the underlying concepts utilized by Bitcoin (and all cryptocurrencies)
                and its revolutionary blockchain technology. Actually, I'm really hoping to get into
                programming NFTs. If all goes well, you can expect me to post my services on sites like
