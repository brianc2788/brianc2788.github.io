                    Due to the smaller size of my projects, repositories have been organized by programming
                    language and contain directories for other projects and their resources within. Due to
                    the contrast with traditional Git repositories, I am issuing this disclaimer. Project
                    directories may contain plaintext source code and/or binaries built for the x86/x64/ARM ISAs.
                    Most are ELF with the exception of many C/Cpp projects, of which contain PE formatted
                    executables compiled with MSVC or MinGW. A few contain binaries for ARM; either 32-bit
                    (armv7l) or 64-bit (armv8+).  Some with portability &AMP; sharing in mind, some not.

            <h1>Moving On...</h1>
            <p>
                More than anything, I just want to move on from recent events.
            </p>
            <p>
                What's more, in an effort to pursue my dream of being a self-made software engineer &AMP;
                developer, I'm planning on getting into Android development. I've long been interested and
                have looked into languages (Java, Kotlin, C++) and tools (IDEs, AVD, etc.), but never got
                serious about it. Personally, I despise the Android operating system, but I'll admit that
                it's a pretty excellent platform for indie/solo developers.
            </p>
            <p>
                As my intentions with this platform is to gain notoriety and/or make money, I would like to
                create some simple games. When I think of <em>Flappy Bird</em>, I think of the amazing
                turn-over and profit from such an extremely simple gameplay loop and simple, 16-bit-esque
                graphics can achieve. I think I could use the assets from the shmup I made to create a
                pretty simple game with intuitive, touch-screen input.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'd also like to create some tools; like a port scanner. Again, because of the closed nature
                of the operating system (did I mention how much I hate it?), there's not a lot of transparency
                when it comes to what's going on under-the-hood. There's a lot of room here for utilities
                to help audit their systems.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm hoping to implement an ad-based model so I can distrubute apps through the platform at
                the low, low price of free. There's going to be a lot of groundwork and years of free games
                and apps to help build a brand. Anyone who would like to get in on the ground floor should
                keep checking back for updates on free stuff!
            </p>
            <p>
                Lol. Thanks.

            <h1>Buffalo, NY - Horrific Xmas Blizzard</h1>
            <p class="warning_banner">From a survivor:</p>
            <p><em>'Twas the night before Christmas</em></p>
            <p>
                <b>I want to thank <u>Mayor Byron Brown</u></b> for being one of the few, local politicians
                who did <u>not</u> take to the airwaves to berate people for their behaviors during this crisis
                (I'd like to point out that I was watching this during one of my <em>daily</em> ER visits).
                I very much appreciate him saying that he "has no feud" with anyone; he seems to be the only
                local leader who understands that most people who <em>forced</em> into making very difficult choices
                during those trying days, as all first-responders had basically abandoned us. In my experience, they
                were paid extra to man their posts during all of this only to reject all cries for help. As someone
                who was out walking dozens upon dozens of miles during this extended weekend, I can attest that the
                streets were a nightmarish free-for-all with absolutely no law enforcement what-so-ever. The facade
                of society had completely broken down.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is probably an unpopular opinion, but it's clear that the impoverished lower-class people in
                Western New York are severely neglected. It's also unacceptable for certain institutions to deny
                people medical treatment during these types of crisis. These institutions blatantly ignored several
                warnings, which made it very clear that this was going to be very extreme weather. I guarentee this
                attitude and lack of action is responsible for the deaths, injuries, illnesses, and other tragic
                circumstances that occurred during this time period.
            </p>
            <p>
                This effects absolutely everyone in the community. If one is to believe that there was too much
                traffic for the city to remove the snow from the streets, then these institutions literally
                telling people to drive to-and-from every day are the ones responsible for thousands of motorists.
                This also happened during the COVID-19 global pandemic; people were forced to attend these facilities,
                causing them to be unable to practice social-distancing in any capacity. Don't be fooled into thinking
                this isn't the status-quo in WNY; it's actually par for the course.
            </p>
            <p>
                I cannot say how disappointed, disheartened, and truly terrified that I am that leaders of WNY are continuously getting away with this.<br>
                <br>
                I've never realized just how <em>alone</em> I truly am.

                Every once in awhile I get an itch to make a video game. These screenshots
                show a couple game demos intended to become a small, vertically-scrolling,
                arcade-style shooter game. Though it's not the first of its kind from me, it's
                my most recent attempt. I started just to try out Python's <em>pygame</em> mod
                which uses bindings for the SDL2 development libraries. The part of game
                development I find most difficult is creating/acquiring assets. Feeling slightly
                more ambitious, I moved on to re-use these assets and rewrite my little game
                engine in C++.<br>
                Currently, I'm still playing with the code at times. I just want to refamiliarize
                myself with SDL2 and a couple of its supporting libraries (image, ttf). I probably
                won't continue on this particular demo for much longer, but after a couple more
                exercises with graphics and GUIs, I might come back to it.<br>
                If the 8-bit esque aesthetics are off-putting to you, feel free to create something
                better and donate it to me! (<em>Lol&lt;3</em>). I was somewhat inspired by the
                original <em>Gameboy</em>'s presentation; so much so that I also considered a
                black-and-puke-green color palette! For those who are interested in game development
                and also struggling with art, there are alternatives, such as buying assets on the
                <em>Unity</em> game engine's online market. Furthermore, for aspiring game developers,
                there's never been a more accessible time. Using <em>Unity</em> as en example again,
                they have their own, entirely unique scripting engine that someone could theoretically
                learn and create a full-on, triple-A video game title from scratch with (don't try this
                at home lol).

                Just wanted to share a few of the books that currently have my attention. I absolutely
                love <em>O'Reilly</em> &AMP; <em>No Starch</em> books. Between these two publications,
                you can learn any technology you want and will get expert tutoring. I greatly prefer
                this over scouring Youtube or the internet for quality content.
            </p>
            <p><b>Network Programming with Go</b> provides an excellent introduction to TCP and UDP
                transport protocols and, of course, uses golang as its medium.<br>
                <b>Black Hat Go</b> is another great book, but should be read <em>after</em> one
                posesses a good foundation of networking and the Go programming language itself.<br>
                <b>Programming Bitcoin</b> is helping me take a deep-dive into elliptic curve
                cryptography and the underlying concepts utilized by Bitcoin (and all cryptocurrencies)
                and its revolutionary blockchain technology. Actually, I'm really hoping to get into
                programming NFTs. If all goes well, you can expect me to post my services on sites like
                <a href="https://www.fiverr.com/">fiverr.com</a> and <a href="https://www.freelancer.com/">
