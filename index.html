            <h2><strong>Update: Sep 13, 2022</strong></h2>
            <p>
                Added a NavBar as a sort of place-holder for future content.<br>
                Truthfully, I don't think I really enjoy front-end development,<br>
                like designing a static web page or dynamic web application. I really<br>
                like InfoSec, although it is a very intimidating, very multi-disciplinary<br>
                type of field with a LOT of competition these days; I was actually hoping<br>
                that making a website would help me see things from the "other side," I.e.,<br>
                I wanted to see if I could make a website and learn some best practices for<br>
                <em>creating</em> something on the web, rather than trying to <em>break</em> it.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                That's why if you get into the industry of IT or InfoSec, you will probably<br>
                end up hearing that developers make good hackers at some point; again, those<br>
                who are good at creating the front and back ends of web sites often know the<br>
                best course of action for pentesting or other security assessments.
            </p>
            <p>
                Even so, I was thinking that, since I already have gotten familiar with Markdown<br>
                and writing <em>Jupyter notebooks</em>, I could just throw those up on here and<br>
                continue adding tutorials, ctf write-ups, etc. As I continue to learn and get better<br>
                with web tech, I would like to write easy-to-understand tutorials for beginners as well<br>
                as contribute more in-depth discussion towards more advanced topics.
            </p>

            <h2><strong>I love the X Files!</strong></h2>
            <p>
                Anybody else out there watching TV over the air? My family has a couple<br>
                antennas, so I will watch it from time to time. I think it's amazing how<br>
                I still prefer not having control of my entertainment sometimes, rather than<br>
                being able to choose when, where, and how you watch or stream anything these<br>
                days.
            </p>
            <p>
                This summer I started watching this channel <em>Comet</em>, which has this very awe-<br>
                some, very nostalgic programming consisting of <em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</em> and<br>
                <em>The X Files</em>.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>Holy crap, I'm in love with the X Files.</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                As I child, I actually grew to strongly dislike shows like <em>The X Files</em>,<br>
                <em>Star Trek</em>, <em>Nick @ Night</em>, etc. because, they pretty much marked<br>
                the end of the TV that I liked, which was of course cartoons.
            </p>
            <p>
                Haha, but I digress, what an amazing show. Agents Mulder & Scully balance each other<br>
                so well -- Mulder, who has a poster in his office that perfectly sums him up, that reads<br>
                <em>"I Want to Believe"</em>, and Scully, who is as pragmatic as she is intelligent.<br>
                Together, they exemplify both the fringe and the level-headed, scientific approaches.
            </p>
            <p>
                I started streaming the series, starting at season 1. I may create an area on the site<br>
                for entertainment-related content. If I do, I'd like to comment more on the show and its<br>
                themes, cast, story, et al. Seems to be a lot there as well. There's a couple movies, some<br>
                video games, and the show itself is 11 seasons. It also seems to take a turn for a more<br>
                comedic tone while also making various statements on political & current events.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Either way, I'm hoping to start to develop the site further; both in terms of code and content.
            </p>

                <em>Thanks for stopping by and highly recommend you check out The X Files if you're late to the party like me.</em>
