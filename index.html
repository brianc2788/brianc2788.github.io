            <h1>Shmup Update - Jan 10, 2023</h1>
            <p>
                I've recently become quite interested in developing my own game. It's something I've
                wanted to do for a long time, but I wanted to do it right. What I mean by that is, basically,
                that I wanted to create my own engine to run my game on. I know it's very normal practice to
                license a game engine, like <em>Unreal</em> or <em>Unity</em>, but I wanted to create my game
                from scratch as much as possible. This is why I've chosen to create the engine from scratch with
                a cross-platform library (like SDL2), which will also be the basis for a 2-D game engine, and I
                plan to move on to using OpenGL for a 3-D engine in the future. Because OpenGL can't really do
                anything beyond graphics, I'll continue to use SDL to handle things like windowing, events, input,
                etc.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm also working on a simple, ping-like game that will have multiplayer. I've done network programming
                before, but I'm very excited to get a chance to try creating a game. I think a game will have its own,
                unique set of challenges. Games are very dynamic applications that need low-latency network solutions
                to facilitate smooth gameplay and visuals.
            </p>
            <p>
                I wanted to also give a shout-out to <a href="https://www.lazyfoo.net">LazyFoo Productions</a>; they have some
                excellent tutorials for using SDL2 &AMP; OpenGL that helped me get my start into using these libraries.

            <h1>Building SFML on Linux</h1>
            <div class="img-box">
            <img src="img/ss_sfml1_01.webp" alt="Screenshot of project sfml1." width="50%">

            <p>
                Hey, all.<br>
                Just wanted to share a couple thoughts after trying out <em>SFML</em>, a library for developing
                cross-platform, graphical applications. I was highly interested in using this library for games
                and GUIs and wanted to see how it compares to another popular library, SDL2. I followed a tutorial
                on the official <em>SFML</em> site, which demonstrated how to quickly create a window, texture, some
                text, and render it to the screen. My first impression is that this is much easier to use than SDL2.
                I can't say a whole lot, since I haven't done much with it yet, but I'm worried that the ease-of-use
                may have trade-offs with granularity and control over certain aspects of the windowing/rendering
                subsystems. At this point, I'm planning to continue to use SDL2 to develop a couple games/demos
                (including the vert. shooter from past posts), but I'm seriously considering a game or GUI with
                SFML afterwards.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'd like to take this as an oppertunity to say how pleased I am with Linux as a development
                environment. Many Linux distributions will have development libraries available in their package
                repositories, but even if yours doesn't, it's still easier to install third-party libraries than
                it is on Windows for Visual Studio (in my humble opinion). Visual Studio and Visual C are notorious,
                especially for new programmers, for being difficult to set options for compilation &AMP; linking.
                For me, using SFML was as simple as installing the libraries via a package manager, adding the include
                directives to the source code, and passing arguments to the compiler/linker (I use the Gnu Compiler
                Collection &AMP; Make).

                So far, I'm pretty happy with the process I have in place for creating these game assets. I've tried
                a few art programs and sprite editors, looking for something to help produce artificial 8-bit/16-bit
                pixelated aesthetics. What you're seeing in the screenshot above is from the <em>Gnu Image Manipulation
                Program</em>, AKA <em>GIMP</em>. I've been utilizing its grid feature to help create these graphics
                inspired by the original <em>Gameboy</em> and its black and green, non-back-lit screen.
                I'm not sure how much will come out of this project. The main goal will be to just see it through to
                a functioning game.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is probably going to be the year I start producing some better, graphical programs. I'm trying
                not to think too far ahead, but I'm also hoping to try out some other graphical libraries, like
                <em>SFML</em> and <em>wxWidgets</em>. These wouldn't be for games, but for graphical, window-based
                GUI applications. I also have <em>Android Studio</em> installed (along with its <em>AVD</em> utility for
                creating virtual devices) and am absolutely dying to make something for droid. This is another oppertunity
                to make games, even multiplayer ones, and I'd really like to create a network/port scanner since Android
                lacks a lot of those tools built-in and I didn't find anything decent in the app store.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lots to think about; this year should be quite graphical. Speaking of Android, I committed some new code
                to my Python3 repository regarding an HTTP server/file-sharing tool.

                Every once in awhile I get an itch to make a video game. These screenshots
                show a couple game demos intended to become a small, vertically-scrolling,
                arcade-style shooter game. Though it's not the first of its kind from me, it's
                my most recent attempt. I started just to try out Python's <em>pygame</em> mod
                which uses bindings for the SDL2 development libraries. The part of game
                development I find most difficult is creating/acquiring assets. Feeling slightly
                more ambitious, I moved on to re-use these assets and rewrite my little game
                engine in C++.<br>
                Currently, I'm still playing with the code at times. I just want to refamiliarize
                myself with SDL2 and a couple of its supporting libraries (image, ttf). I probably
                won't continue on this particular demo for much longer, but after a couple more
                exercises with graphics and GUIs, I might come back to it.<br>
                If the 8-bit esque aesthetics are off-putting to you, feel free to create something
                better and donate it to me! (<em>Lol&lt;3</em>). I was somewhat inspired by the
                original <em>Gameboy</em>'s presentation; so much so that I also considered a
                black-and-puke-green color palette! For those who are interested in game development
                and also struggling with art, there are alternatives, such as buying assets on the
                <em>Unity</em> game engine's online market. Furthermore, for aspiring game developers,
                there's never been a more accessible time. Using <em>Unity</em> as en example again,
                they have their own, entirely unique scripting engine that someone could theoretically
                learn and create a full-on, triple-A video game title from scratch with (don't try this
                at home lol).

                Just wanted to share a few of the books that currently have my attention. I absolutely
                love <em>O'Reilly</em> &AMP; <em>No Starch</em> books. Between these two publications,
                you can learn any technology you want and will get expert tutoring. I greatly prefer
                this over scouring Youtube or the internet for quality content.
            </p>
            <p><b>Network Programming with Go</b> provides an excellent introduction to TCP and UDP
                transport protocols and, of course, uses golang as its medium.<br>
                <b>Black Hat Go</b> is another great book, but should be read <em>after</em> one
                posesses a good foundation of networking and the Go programming language itself.<br>
                <b>Programming Bitcoin</b> is helping me take a deep-dive into elliptic curve
                cryptography and the underlying concepts utilized by Bitcoin (and all cryptocurrencies)
                and its revolutionary blockchain technology. Actually, I'm really hoping to get into
                programming NFTs. If all goes well, you can expect me to post my services on sites like
