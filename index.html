                    Due to the smaller size of my projects, repositories have been organized by programming
                    language and contain directories for other projects and their resources within. Due to
                    the contrast with traditional Git repositories, I am issuing this disclaimer. Project
                    directories may contain plaintext source code and/or binaries built for the x86/x64/ARM ISAs.
                    Most are ELF with the exception of many C/Cpp projects, of which contain PE formatted
                    executables compiled with MSVC or MinGW. A few contain binaries for ARM; either 32-bit
                    (armv7l) or 64-bit (armv8+).  Some with portability &AMP; sharing in mind, some not.

                Every once in awhile I get an itch to make a video game. These screenshots
                show a couple game demos intended to become a small, vertically-scrolling,
                arcade-style shooter game. Though it's not the first of its kind from me, it's
                my most recent attempt. I started just to try out Python's <em>pygame</em> mod
                which uses bindings for the SDL2 development libraries. The part of game
                development I find most difficult is creating/acquiring assets. Feeling slightly
                more ambitious, I moved on to re-use these assets and rewrite my little game
                engine in C++.<br>
                Currently, I'm still playing with the code at times. I just want to refamiliarize
                myself with SDL2 and a couple of its supporting libraries (image, ttf). I probably
                won't continue on this particular demo for much longer, but after a couple more
                exercises with graphics and GUIs, I might come back to it.<br>
                If the 8-bit esque aesthetics are off-putting to you, feel free to create something
                better and donate it to me! (<em>Lol&lt;3</em>). I was somewhat inspired by the
                original <em>Gameboy</em>'s presentation; so much so that I also considered a
                black-and-puke-green color palette! For those who are interested in game development
                and also struggling with art, there are alternatives, such as buying assets on the
                <em>Unity</em> game engine's online market. Furthermore, for aspiring game developers,
                there's never been a more accessible time. Using <em>Unity</em> as en example again,
                they have their own, entirely unique scripting engine that someone could theoretically
                learn and create a full-on, triple-A video game title from scratch with (don't try this
                at home lol).

                Just wanted to share a few of the books that currently have my attention. I absolutely
                love <em>O'Reilly</em> &AMP; <em>No Starch</em> books. Between these two publications,
                you can learn any technology you want and will get expert tutoring. I greatly prefer
                this over scouring Youtube or the internet for quality content.
            </p>
            <p><b>Network Programming with Go</b> provides an excellent introduction to TCP and UDP
                transport protocols and, of course, uses golang as its medium.<br>
                <b>Black Hat Go</b> is another great book, but should be read <em>after</em> one
                posesses a good foundation of networking and the Go programming language itself.<br>
                <b>Programming Bitcoin</b> is helping me take a deep-dive into elliptic curve
                cryptography and the underlying concepts utilized by Bitcoin (and all cryptocurrencies)
                and its revolutionary blockchain technology. Actually, I'm really hoping to get into
                programming NFTs. If all goes well, you can expect me to post my services on sites like
                <a href="https://www.fiverr.com/">fiverr.com</a> and <a href="https://www.freelancer.com/">
                freelancer.com</a>.
